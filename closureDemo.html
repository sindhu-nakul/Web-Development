        <!--A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer functionâ€™s variables in addition to it's own variables and global variables. In simple terms a closure is function inside a function. These functions, that is the inner and outer functions could be named functions or anonymous functions. In the example below we have an anonymous function inside another anonymous function. The variable incrementClickCount is assigned the return value of the self invoking anonymous function.-->

            <!--If the pair of paranthesis is not included in the incrementCountOnClick it will execute only once and the inner function will not be called. On including paranthesis for incrementCountOnClick it will call the inner (second) anonymous function and the clickCount will be excuted and counter will get incremented-->
